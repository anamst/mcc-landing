                <p class="text-left text-black text-sm pt-6 lg:w-3/4">The Fund is a “neutral fund” because it does not promote sustainability nor has it sustainable investment as its objective.</p> 
                <p class="text-left text-black text-sm pt-6 lg:w-3/4">SFDR distinguishes three regimes:</p> 
                <ul class="list-decimal pl-10">
                    <li>The neutral regime for investment funds that do not have sustainability features;

                    <li class="pt-4">A <strong>"sustainable investment"</strong> is defined as an investment in an economic activity that contributes to an environmental objective, as measured, for example, by key resource efficiency indicators on the use of energy, renewable energy, raw materials, water and land, on the production of waste, and greenhouse gas emissions, or on its impact on biodiversity and the circular economy, or an investment in an economic activity that contributes to a social objective, in particular an investment that contributes to tackling inequality or that fosters social cohesion, social integration and labor relations, or an investment in human capital or economically or socially disadvantaged communities, provided that such investments do not significantly harm any of those objectives and that the investee companies follow good governance practices, in particular with respect to sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of staff and tax compliance.</li>
                    <li class="pt-4"><strong>"No significant harm"</strong> means that for each environmental objective, uniform criteria for determining whether economic activities contribute substantially to that objective should be laid down. One element of the uniform criteria should be to avoid significant harm to any of the environmental objectives. This is in order to avoid that investments qualify as environmentally sustainable in cases where the economic activities benefitting from those investments cause harm to the environment to an extent that outweighs their contribution to an environmental objective.</li>
                    <li class="pt-4"><strong>"Environmental objective"</strong> means the objectives as laid down in Article 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation, being the following objectives:

                    <li class="pt-4"><strong>"Sustainability factors"</strong> mean environmental or social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. This is what is or can be impacted by investment decisions.

                    </li>
                    <li>since the portfolio companies in which the Fund it manages invest do not usually report on such risks, the Fund Manager is not in a position to assess and integrate such risks in its investment decision-making process;
                    </li>
                    <li>the Fund Manager is managing the Fund that intends to invest in companies across sectors like fintech, blockchain, deep tech, Cyber Security and machine learning / Artificial Intelligence, for which the returns should not be impacted by sustainability risks; and
                    </li>
                    <li>in view of the Fund Manager's size it is not intended to change the investment decision-making process of the Fund Manager to integrate such sustainability risks as this will be too costly and not relevant with respect to the Fund it manages.

                </p>
                <p class="text-left text-black text-sm pt-6 lg:w-2/3">The Fund Manager does not consider the adverse impacts of its investments decisions on sustainability factors at its own level and in respect of investments of the Fund in the manner prescribed by SFDR due to (i) the venture capital investment objectives of the investments that do not take sustainability into account, (ii) the lack of reliable and sufficiently available or accessible data to perform such impact measurement and to provide the mandatory reporting imposed by the regulatory technical standards in a consistent manner, and (iii) the underlying investments in seed and post seed stage portfolio companies are not generally required or able to report on such factors in the manner prescribed by SFDR.
